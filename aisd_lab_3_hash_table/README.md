# Hashing algorithm- chain hashing
Hashing is a method to store data in a efficient way (easy to find objects). It uses hash code to distinguish every element in hash table (array). 


Chain hashing uses hash code, and fetch it to the number of array index. In situation, when in certain position is an element (collision), on this position the algorithm builds a linked list and new element is insereted at the beginning of the list. <br />
My code also performes deleting and getting element from hash table.


In test packages are tests of code and it's performance.
