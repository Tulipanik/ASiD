## Sorting algorithms
In src package is an implementation of some sorting algorithms:
* Selection sort- the strategy here is to select the smallest element in array and put it at the beginning of the array,
* Insertion sort- the sort begins from the beginning of the array. The elements are putted in correct position in the beggining array,
* Quick sort- that algorithm is an example of devide and conquer method. In simple it uses a recursion to perform a sorting. In my case I used stack to perform same effect with less space complexity,
* Heap sort- This alghoritm use binary tree to perform sorting. The rule in tree makes root the gratest element in it.
  
RefAlghoritms is a file that use implemented in java libaries sorting method.
In test package are tests of all implemented methods. <br />
There is also a performance package that measure and compare times of sorting in optimistic, neutral and pesimistic case.
